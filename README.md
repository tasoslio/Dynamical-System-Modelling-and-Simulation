# Dynamical-System-Modelling-and-Simulation
This assignment took place in the course "Dynamical System Modelling and Simulation" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at 8th Semester. It contains two parts which described below.

## :ledger: Description 
### Part 1
The first part focuses on linear parameterization and estimating unknown parameters using offline parameter estimation techniques. Specifically, the offline version of the Least Squares Method is employed, which minimizes the estimation error criteria to determine the true values of the unknown parameters in two types of systems. For this method to be applicable, the parameters must appear in a linear form. The systems analyzed are a mass-spring-damper system and an RLC circuit.

### Part 2
The second part of the assignment shares the same objective as the first: estimating unknown parameters. However, this section utilizes real-time (online) techniques, specifically the Gradient Method and the Lyapunov Method (employing both Parallel and Series-Parallel models). These methods are applied to a scalar system in exercises 1 and 2, while the Lyapunov Method is additionally applied to a second-order system in exercise 3.
